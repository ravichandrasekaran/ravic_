From the Riddler, a [cheese cutting effort.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-beat-the-goat-monty-hall-problem/)

> From Andrew Heairet comes a puzzle that is sure to whet your appetite:

> You and a friend are grilling two small square burger patties whose sides are 5 centimeters long. However, you only have one slice of cheese remaining, which is also square and whose sides are 7 centimeters long. You want to cut the slice so that all of the cheese is evenly split between the two patties, and no cheese is spilling over either patty and onto the grill.

> What is the smallest number of cuts you need to make? You can only make straight cuts, and you should assume that the cheese is stationary during the cutting process.


## Three cuts!
**Yes, three cuts!** Let's break it down.

#### The cheese
Here's our cheese, 7-cm &times; 7-cm, scored with a 1-cm grid as one often sees.

#### The burger as guide
We're going to overlay the square burger on top of the cheese, centered 
and rotated 45 degrees, which will guide our first two cuts. 

Even though it looks like the burger can be inscribed within the cheese, 
it's just a tad bigger than the cheese, and the corners overshoot a bit.
By how much? The side of the cheese is 7-cm. The diagonal of the 5-cm 
patty is $5\sqrt{2}$ or about 7.07-cm. Not over by much, but noticeable.

#### First two cuts
We're going to to cut along the top and bottom of the rotated patty.

#### Third cut

Now that we have a 5-cm wide stripe across the diagonal of our cheese, we're
going to cut across the other diagonal.

#### Rearranging

We're going to rearrange the four smaller triangles to make something 
that looks like a two larger, nearly 5-cm squares. These are all 
isoceles right triangles with side length of $a = \frac{1}{2}(7\sqrt{2} - 5)$ or about 2.45-cm.  
So they'll fit, but look ever so slightly off when we arrange them.

#### Measuring
Now, just to make sure they fit our 5-cm patties, we'll take a look on our graph
paper what our final product looks like after a bit of rotation. It's a little 
easier to see that we have this small leftover strip around the triangles, which
makes sense. Our cheese area was 7-cm &times; 7-cm or 49-cm, and our patty area is 
50-cm, so the cheese can't quite cover the meat regardless of how hard we try!
