### To listen

1.  Ologies
6. "I just binged every available episode of Now &amp; Then by @HC_Richardson &amp; @jbf1755while doing touch-up trim painting. Fabulous history presented in these podcasts that ties the past to what's happening today. https://t.co/iFYRvBroPF," --maximum_mew [Jun 28](https://twitter.com/16494635/status/1409635858303447041)

### For thought
10. "I think hedgefunds are the most suited to remote work because there's a lot of "daily action", which provides alternative fuel for bonding, normally powered by Duchenne smiles. And the pre-PMF startups are the worst hit, because the coworker Duchenne is all they have.," --danielgross [Jun 29](https://twitter.com/38190583/status/1409861159910621186)
5. "It is important to consider company stage when thinking about how to intervene to up your product game. What "works" in a big company will not work in a startup.At @Amplitude_HQ we tailor our coaching/feedback to meet companies where they are.(a quick morning activity ‚¨áÔ∏è). https://t.co/UGMFiHRqEO," --johncutlefish [Jun 28](https://twitter.com/533409964/status/1409580615368773634)
1. "We can't keep regulating AI as if it..works. Most policy interventions start with the assumption that the technology lives up to its claims of performance but policymakers &amp; critical scholars need to stop falling for the corporate hype and should scrutinize these claims more.," --rajiinio [Jun 28](https://twitter.com/985158406125375488/status/1409333845795622912)
