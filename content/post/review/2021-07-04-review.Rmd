### For thought
10. Daily action, smiles as team bonding glue  
  "I think hedgefunds are the most suited to remote work because there's a lot of 'daily action', which provides alternative fuel for bonding, normally powered by Duchenne smiles. And the pre-PMF startups are the worst hit, because the coworker Duchenne is all they have.," --danielgross [Jun 29](https://twitter.com/38190583/status/1409861159910621186)
1. "We can't keep regulating AI as if it..works. Most policy interventions start with the assumption that the technology lives up to its claims of performance but policymakers &amp; critical scholars need to stop falling for the corporate hype and should scrutinize these claims more.," --rajiinio [Jun 28](https://twitter.com/985158406125375488/status/1409333845795622912)
34. Inverting the problem.  
  Examples from [Charlie Munger](https://twitter.com/11336782/status/1411398340592295938) and the [CIA](https://twitter.com/2988396162/status/1410580982810431494).  "An important lesson from Charlie Munger from this article is that even if you can‚Äôt figure out the right solution to a problem, you can get very far by cataloging and avoiding all the wrong things."

30. "Fundamental attribution error is our tendency to blame (or credit) the PERSON instead of the SITUATION. Everyone has high &amp; low periods in their lives that are beyond their control.  And even the most adaptable people struggle in some environments &amp; easily succeed in others.," --cindyalvarez [Jul 02](https://twitter.com/14164956/status/1411002488359067652)
