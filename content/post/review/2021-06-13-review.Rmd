> The best way to experience a restaurant, I have always felt, is by eating exactly what it wants to feed you. I do not want choices. I want the best thing. A restaurant might have five or ten best things, but it cannot have 45. There are many infuriating things about the world, but one of the more fixable is the sensation of acute regret from having ordered wrong. 
> ...
> 
> A short menu, though, exudes confidence. It is a statement. It commands respect. Without the padding of half-hearted roasted cauliflower and ambivalent crostini, a short-menued restaurant has decided exactly what it is. 
> ...
> 
> A small menu is a gift. You, the host, will do the labor of finding a small menu that is reasonably appropriate, thus allowing your companions to bask in the minor pleasure of thinking less.
