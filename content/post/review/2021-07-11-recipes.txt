HONEY, SOY, AND GINGER BRAISED TOFU
Sodha, Meera. East (p. 175). 

Serves 2

10 oz extra-firm tofu 
2 tbsp soy sauce 
1½ tbsp honey (or agave syrup if vegan) 
3 cloves of garlic, crushed 
½ inch ginger, peeled and grated 
1 Bartlett pear, grated 
4 green onions, finely chopped, whites and greens separated 
2 tbsp toasted sesame oil 
1½ tsp gochujang paste 
2 tbsp canola oil 
a handful of black and white sesame seeds, to serve

Lightly press the tofu block between your hands over the sink to get rid of as much water as possible, then wrap in paper towels and leave to one side. 

Place the soy sauce, honey, garlic, ginger, pear, green onion whites, sesame oil, gochujang, and 1 tablespoon of water into a bowl and whisk to mix. Remove the tofu from the kitchen paper and cut into ½-inch-thick slices. 

Coat the bottom of a large non-stick frying pan with the canola oil and line a plate with a couple of sheets of paper towel. Heat the oil until it reaches smoking point and fry the tofu slices for 8 minutes until golden on both sides. Remove the tofu to the plate, allowing the paper to absorb some of the excess oil. 

Remove all but a tablespoon of oil from the pan. Add the soy and honey sauce and stir for a minute, then put the tofu back into the pan and cook for 5 minutes until the sauce reduces and becomes glossy and thick. 

To serve, place the tofu in a serving dish, pour the sauce over the top, and sprinkle with the sesame seeds and remaining green onion.

Notes:
* 1 package tofu, but double the sauce
* Oil doesn't need to be at smoking point, and cool down before doing up the sauce.

LEMON OAT BARS
Kieffer, Sarah. 100 Cookies (p. 247). Chronicle Books LLC. Kindle Edition. 

*Filling*
Two 14 oz [396 g] cans sweetened condensed milk 
1/2 cup [120 g] lemon juice 
3 tablespoons heavy cream 
1 tablespoon lemon zest 
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
Pinch salt 

*Crust*
2 cups [284 g] all-purpose flour 
1-1/2 cups [120 g] rolled oats 
1/2 cup [100 g] brown sugar 
1/4 cup [50 g] granulated sugar 
1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
2 sticks [227 g] unsalted butter, at room temperature

Adjust an oven rack to the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350°F [180°C]. Grease a 9 by 13 in [22 by 33 cm] pan and line it with a parchment sling. 

FOR THE FILLING In a large bowl, whisk together the sweetened condensed milk, lemon juice, heavy cream, zest, vanilla, and salt. 

FOR THE CRUST In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle, mix the flour, oats, brown and granulated sugars, baking soda, and salt on low speed to combine. Add the butter and mix on medium speed until the mixture is crumbly. 

TO ASSEMBLE

1) Press half of the oat mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and carefully spread the filling over the crust. Sprinkle the remaining oat mixture evenly over the top. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the filling is set and does not jiggle and the crumbly top is light golden brown. 

2) Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool. Place the pan in the refrigerator and chill for 4 to 6 hours. Slice the bars and serve. The bars can be served cold or at room temperature but keep best in an airtight container in the refrigerator for about 3 days.

Stir-Fried Broccoli with Sichuan Peppercorns
Start to finish: 30 minutes | Servings: 4
https://www.wgbh.org/dining-in/2019/11/25/spicy-stir-fried-broccoli-with-sichuan-peppercorns


1⁄3 cup plus 2 tablespoons water, divided
3 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar, divided 11⁄2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon white sugar
1⁄4 teaspoon kosher salt
3 medium garlic cloves, finely grated
11⁄2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
1⁄4 to 1⁄2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 scallions, white and pale green parts minced, dark green parts thinly sliced on bias
11⁄4 pounds broccoli, florets cut into 1-inch pieces, stems peeled and sliced 1⁄4-inch thick
3 tablespoons peanut or grapeseed oil, divided
2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
1⁄2 to 1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns, toasted and finely ground


INSTRUCTIONS:

In a small bowl, stir together the 1⁄3 cup water, 2 tablespoons of the vinegar, the soy sauce and sugar. In a second small bowl, stir together the remaining 2 tablespoons water and the salt. In a third small bowl, combine the garlic, ginger, pepper flakes and minced scallions.

In a large skillet over medium-high, combine the broccoli, salt water and 2 tablespoons of the peanut oil. Cover and cook for 1 minute; the water should reach a simmer. Uncover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the broccoli is crisp-tender and browned in spots, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a large plate.

Return the skillet to medium-high, add the remaining 1 tablespoon peanut oil and the garlic-ginger mixture. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, 10 to 15 seconds. Add the vinegar-soy sauce mixture and simmer, stirring and scraping up any browned bits, until slightly reduced, 2 to 3 minutes. Return the broccoli to the skillet and stir to coat.

Off heat, stir in the sesame oil, remaining 1 tablespoon of vinegar and 1⁄2 teaspoon of the ground Sichuan peppercorns. Taste and add more peppercorns, if desired. Serve sprinkled with the sliced scallion greens.

Notes: Don't over toast the Sichuan peppercorns. It's better to err on the side of lightly toasted, as the peppercorns become unpleasantly bitter if overdone.

To enhance their flavor and aroma, the team toasted the peppercorns in a small skillet over medium heat for about 2 minutes, let them cool, then ground them to a fine powder in a spice grinder.
