<h3>Cooked</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Chili Fish Curry, “S is for Sri Lanka” ★★★<br />
This could be a really good meal - the coconut + tomato + fish was really
flavorful, and the timing on the steps was good. But replacing onion with
பெருங்காயம் was not a great move.</li>
<li>Lemon bars, “101 Cookies”. ★★★★<br />
Nice, but the lemon could definitely be more pronounced.</li>

<h3>Seen</h3>

<li>Haikyu!!. ★★★<br />
Need to find another good competition manga after this is done.</li>
<li>Edge of Tomorrow. ★★★★<br />
Emily Blunt + Tom Cruise somehow works. Re-watch, and still holds up. End
is still weirdly resolved.</li>

“I think hedgefunds are the most suited to remote work because there’s a lot of ‘daily action’, which provides alternative fuel for bonding, normally powered by Duchenne smiles. And the pre-PMF startups are the worst hit, because the coworker Duchenne is all they have.,” –danielgross <a href="https://twitter.com/38190583/status/1409861159910621186">Jun 29</a></li>
