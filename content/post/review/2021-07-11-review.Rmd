### Cooked

1.  Chili Fish Curry, "S is for Sri Lanka". ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  
    This could be a really good meal - the coconut + tomato + fish was really 
    flavorful, and the timing on the steps was good. But replacing onion with
    ‡Æ™‡ØÜ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡ÆÆ‡Øç was not a great move.
2.  Lemon bars, "101 Cookies", Sarah Kieffer. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ     
    Nice, but the lemon could definitely be more pronounced.
3.  Honey, Soy, and Ginger Braised Tofu, "East", Meera Sodha. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  
    With some broccoli and rice. Lower the heat of the oil, double the sauce.
4.  Rajasthani-Cucumber Sushi. 
5.  Mango-Avocado Salad. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
    Good mango, but didn't need the balsamic. 
6.  Vegetables in Spiced Coconut Milk. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  
    Simple, yummy. Kind of like a Keralite avial
7.  Lime dhal. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  
    Water and simmer/cook time is still off. Trying the tadka without the onion
    is a poor choice.
8.  Curry leaf popcorn chicken, Nik Sharma. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
9.  Doriyaki pancakes with blueberry crema, Meena Sodha, East. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  
    The cream filling was good, but the doriyaki recipe was way off. Need flour
    measurements in weights at least.
10. Ricotta-lemon pasta.

    
### Seen

1.  Haikyu!!. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  
    Need to find another good competition manga after this is done.
2.  Edge of Tomorrow. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  
    Emily Blunt + Tom Cruise somehow works. Re-watch, and still holds up. End 
    is still weirdly resolved.


### Listened

2.  **"Why Do We Work So Damn Much?"**, Ezra Klein Show with [James Suzman](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/29/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-james-suzman.html)
3.  useR conference session. From Sevvandi Kandanaarachchi (Hyndman lab at Monash) 
    had `{dobit}` and `{lookout}` for 
    anomaly detection, both of which looked really interesting -- especially the
    idea of dimensionality reduction preserving the outliers, rather than minimizing
    the variance. The `{maars}` package (Riccardo Fogliato, Shamindra Shrotriya, 
    out of the Kuchibhotla lab in CMU) also looked good for linear regression 
    with violations of assumptions, replacing things like `{sandwich}` with an
    integrated design.

1.  Adam Grant, [revisiting][grant-revisit] [languishing][grant-languish].  
    Curious about this "collective effervescence" idea from √âmile Durkheim. The 
    antidote supplied by [Dani Blum][blum-flourish] is almost too simple.
