<h3>Critique</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The choice here is two line series. They track very closely, so not sure the
second series gives a lot of information. Color choices are opposite of the
U.S. gas colors, but maybe that’s ok. (Makes the removed legend a challenge,
though). Axes are pretty straightforward. The cushion underneath the lines
feels good - close to the 30% heuristic.</li>
<li>Would love a history here - not just what the chart values on hover are
(which is nice), but an explanation of the changepoints.</li>
<li>For our current uses, we’re probably more interested in changes than absolute
indices.</li>

<div id="questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The two indices basically track. Does one forecast the other? Can we think
of this like FedEx shipping volumes dropping as a recessionary indicator?
Might expect more volatility in diesel (smaller supply, specialized
refinement)?</li>
<li>Does the 10-year rolling average hide insights? Do we need to see (multiple)
shorter windows? Longer windows?</li>
<li>We’re obviously seeing a recent plunge – unparalleled during tracking?
Suddenness of change? Changepoint analysis? The suddenness at the end isn’t
like the US unemployment stats – it’s not enough to pop by itself.</li>
<li>Do we understand the drop-off in previous cycles? Do demand shocks (like
current Coronavirus shock and 2008 financial collapse) behave differently?</li>
<li>In the United States, we have seasonality in our prices. Do those not
materialize here?</li>
<li>Doesn’t foot with our mental model of petroleum - shouldn’t the negative
prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) mean something for the price at the
pump?</li>

<div id="percent-changes" class="section level4">
<h4>Percent changes</h4>
<p>Here, we’re taking a lot of liberty by lagging a rolling average against a
rolling average. That’s probably not great, so we need to figure out how to
smooth the values appropriately.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we can start to see the really strong slope changes - not just
currently, but the multi-stage dropoff leading into the 2008 recession. Diesel
seems a bit more muted in declines.</p>
<p>We should probably look at sequential declines, not single week drop-off,
though. The recent decline is at least 15%, and that’s not reflected well.</p>

<p>Attempted to use <code>changepoint</code> library, but this really isn’t anywhere near
stable enough.</p>
