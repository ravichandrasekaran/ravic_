<div id="questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The two indices basically track. Does one forecast the other? Can we think
of this like FedEx shipping volumes dropping as a recessionary indicator?</li>
<li>Does the 10-year rolling average hide insights?</li>
<li>We’re obviously seeing a recent plunge – unparalleled during tracking?
Suddenness of change? Changepoint analysis? The suddenness at the end isn’t
like the US unemployment stats – it’s not enough to pop by itself.</li>
<li>Do we understand the drop-off in previous cycles?</li>
<li>In the United States, we have seasonality in our prices. Do those not
materialize here?</li>
</ol>

<div id="critique" class="section level3">
<h3>Critique</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The choice here is two line series. They track very closely, so not sure the
second series gives a lot of information. Color choices are opposite of the
U.S. gas colors, but maybe that’s ok. (Makes the removed legend a challenge,
though). Axes are pretty straightforward. The cushion underneath the lines
feels good - close to the 30% heuristic.</li>
<li>Would love a history here - not just what the chart values on hover are
(which is nice), but an explanation of the changepoints.</li>
<li>For our current uses, we’re probably more interested in changes than absolute
indices.</li>
