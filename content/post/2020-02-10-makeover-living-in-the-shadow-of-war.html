<h2>Critique</h2>
<p><strong>What works?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What doesn’t work?</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Perhaps because of the constraints of print, there is a lot to look at.
Each year is detailed as a small multiple, but as a reader, I’m likely
to explore only a handful of birth years – my own, my child’s, and my
parents. Interactivity?</li>
<li>The outside dial doesn’t show the years under war, but the <em>fraction of
life</em> under war. That’s a harder concept, and because the lifespans change
across the figure, the fractions also change.</li>
<li>The dual dial structure is challenging, especially without the individual
example shown in the article. The inside pie is an aggregation of the
outside progression.</li>
<li>The really reductive view could be that this is a lot of ink to say that
the conflict in Afghanistan is historically long.</li>
<li>Another strange artifact is that the 3-year olds present have 100% of their
lifespan in the shadow of war – but that many other 3-year olds have faced
similar. Something like a survival analysis here, where we cannot foretell
how the lifes unfold – but could look at it like a cohort.</li>
