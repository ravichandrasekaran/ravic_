<h3>Spotlight: United States</h3>
<p>The United States has steady data from 2003-2015 in this dataset (perhaps
from the Census Time Use Survey?).</p>
<p>The timeframe includes some significant events (recoveries from 9/11, 2008
financial shocks). The 2008 shock does seem visible in the men’s paid labor
metrics – without recovery – but without any concurrent changes in men’s
unpaid labor or women’s labor metrics.</p>
<p>It’s hard to gauge from the survey results, but it does seem like there is
some reduction in women’s reported unpaid labor into early part of 2010’s.
Is this simply choosing to spend less time here?</p>

<li>“Bring home the bacon.”</li>
<li>Rosie the Riveter is about women’s paid labor. Timely brief (COVID vs. WW2)?</li>
