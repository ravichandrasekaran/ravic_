<div id="what-works" class="section level2">
<h2>What works</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Interactivity is good. Stories in each country are very
different.</li>
<li>People and bridges in the key box are amazing testaments
to impact. And divide by time for rate of impact, and it
is pretty remarkable.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="what-doesnt-work" class="section level2">
<h2>What doesn’t work</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Dry, CIA-briefing style.</li>
<li>Some metrics like HDI and rural access index are tough to
understand or score. And are they trending up – do they
show our impact (more than people and bridges)?</li>
<li>Is this better?
<a href="https://bridgestoprosperity.org/projects/coko-suspended-footbridge/">Coko suspended footbridge</a></li>
<li>Under-selling where we’d go next? “Total identified sites”,
and “Estimated people without safe access” metrics.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="early-thoughts" class="section level2">
<h2>Early thoughts</h2>
<p>Message:
1. We’re trying to show that this activity has had a strong
impact - we’re turning investment into changed lives. And
we have a proven record, so re-up the investment. (Maybe
where we’d go next?)
2. Country-level maps feel empty - how do we connect with these
far-flung areas?</p>
<p>Bridge data:
1. Each bridge has a span length, and they are surprisingly long.
Does this help ground the challenge of the river - size, storm
surge, etc? Walking time?
2. For each bridge, there’s an estimate of population affected.
Can we make this feel real? Show clusters near the river,
alternative routes? Isotype? Animation of figures crossing
bridges?
3. Completion year. Change to do some temporo-spatial animation?</p>
<p>Can we obtain:
1. Tax records?
2. Population centers?
3. Cleaned maps, high-resolution of Rwanda?</p>
