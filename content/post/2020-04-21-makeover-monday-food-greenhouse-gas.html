<h3>Notes from original</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>“Pound-for-pound”.</li>
<li>Beef is bad. Beef has more total greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
<li>A range of different approaches – “Eat Local.”, “Farm to Table”, “Raw food”,
“Vegan” - have different impacts</li>
<li>The original authors are pushing more for consumers to adopt plant-based meat,
and avoid discretionary things like sugar/stimulants/alcohol.</li>
<li>The revised article discussion focuses more on the fallacy of “Eat Local.”
But even more, that highlights that our mental model of food + greenhouse gases
is wrong.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="concept-notes" class="section level3">
<h3>Concept notes</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Beef is far and away the biggest greenhouse gas producer using these
metrics.</li>
<li>There are lots of pairwise comparisons for explainers. New Zealand
lamb vs. beef, dairy vs. beef herd, seafood farming, etc. Each one
might expose a piece of the mental model that’s missing.</li>
<li>Can we distill down the protein message? Substitute plants generally.
Believe in the Impossible (Burger). Land use is a big deal.</li>
<li>Many ways to prioritize, not all represented (e.g. water use). Can
we expose that directly? “Eat Local” vs. “Avoid processed”</li>
<li>The metric is weird, and hard to grasp (kg of <span class="math inline">\(\text{CO}_2\)</span>)? And
the kg of food product is not how we consume - especially when
considering substitutes.</li>
</ol>
<div id="reproduction" class="section level4">
<h4>Reproduction</h4>
<p>Like always, start with a basic reproduction.</p>

<div id="lollipop" class="section level4">
<h4>Lollipop</h4>
<p>This is getting closer to something possibly useful. We’re starting with
a message that by any measure, beef is <strong>crazy high</strong>. So, basically, we
need a scorecard.</p>
<p><em>Design notes</em>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Land use, farm, and possibly feed need to be listed at the top.
(Not clear what the sort is now.)</li>
<li>Colors could be more precise. Meat should be red and pink, plants green
and brown.</li>
<li>Gridding seems excessive.</li>
<li>Can we drop one?</li>
<li>Annotations!</li>
<li>We’re losing some precision in the plant-based protein. That’s ok, right?</li>
<li>Is cheese a protein? Is soymilk a protein?</li>
</ol>

<h4>Other concepts</h4>
<ul>
<li>Thought about a radar chart here, but this strong critique advised me against it.
