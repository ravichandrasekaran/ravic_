<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>“Pound-for-pound”.</li>
<li>Beef is bad. Beef has more total greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
<li>A range of different approaches – “Eat Local.”, “Farm to Table”, “Raw food”,
“Vegan” - have different impacts</li>
<li>The original authors are pushing more for consumers to adopt plant-based meat,
and avoid discretionary things like sugar/stimulants/alcohol.</li>
<li>The revised article discussion focuses more on the fallacy of “Eat Local.”
But even more, that highlights that our mental model of food + greenhouse gases
is wrong.</li>
