<p>Here I am writing a blog post using blogdown! Amazing stuff!
<!--more--></p>
<p>First and foremost, thank you to Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and
Alison Presmanes Hill!</p>
<p>Guides:</p>

</ol>
<p>The process is a little tedious, with some minor tweaks, but it’s still
magical that it works, and flows so easily from within RStudio.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Dr. Hill mentions being careful with the <code>baseurl</code> parameter two or three
times. <em>Please, please do that.</em> I can say from experience that it’s not
obvious why the blog doesn’t look right without that attention. :)<br />
 </li>
<li>Both references mention to edit the <code>.gitignore</code> file if using Netlify,
to exclude the <code>public/</code> directory that is generated when serving the
site locally. That’s a really good thing to follow – it avoids tracking
a ton of extra files that you don’t want to track.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>I’m using Marcus Brinkmann’s <a href="https://github.com/lambdafu/hugo-finite">hugo-finite</a>
theme, in part because it comes out-of-the-box with equation support, and
in part because <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/">Kieran Healy’s blog</a> based
on a similar theme looks gorgeous.<br />
<br />
Hugo-finite requires a higher version of Hugo for the Netlify build than the default,
so pay attention to the environment variable.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Using math?<br />
4.1. Make sure you include <code>math = true</code> in the <code>[params]</code> section.<br />
<br />
4.2. The underlying KaTeX system doesn’t use the <code>align</code> environment, but
instead uses <code>aligned</code>.<br />
<br />
4.3. This isn’t purely about math, but the default content summary for the
index page is the first 70 words of the post. This doesn’t work well,
especially if an equation appears early. Using <code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code>, as shown
in the <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/summaries/">Hugo docs</a>
is definitely helpful.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>There is more to look at in the equation setup, like line height. Saving
the <a href="https://katex.org/docs/issues.html">KaTeX Common Issues page</a> for later.
:)<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Yihui Xie mentions broadly that tables are complicated. The default
rendering for the HTML table using <code>kable</code> and <code>kableExtra</code> libraries and
the underlying Zurb Foundation library leaves a lot to be desired. Will
want to dig in when I have more time.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Use hyphens in your chunks!</li>
