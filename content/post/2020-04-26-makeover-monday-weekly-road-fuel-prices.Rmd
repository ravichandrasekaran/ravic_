### Replicate original

```{r replicate_original, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8}
# TODO - Refine panel, labels in line (or in subtitle)
df %>%
  gather(key = "fuel_type", value = "price_per_litre", -date) %>%
  mutate(fuel_type = fct_recode(fuel_type,
                                Diesel = "diesel_usd", Petrol = "petrol_usd")) %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.)) %>%
  filter(date > ymd("2010-04-01")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, price_per_litre)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour = fuel_type)) +
  theme_light() + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year") +
  labs(title = "Comparison of petrol vs. diesel fuel prices",
       subtitle = "Average retail pump prices per litre (pence), measured weekly",
       x = "", 
       y = "",
       colour = "Fuel type",
       caption = "RAC Foundation (Source: BEIS)") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(80, 160), 
                     labels = scales::comma_format(suffix = "p"))

```

### Questions

1.  The two indices basically track. Does one forecast the other? Can we think
    of this like FedEx shipping volumes dropping as a recessionary indicator? 
2.  Does the 10-year rolling average hide insights? 
3.  We're obviously seeing a recent plunge -- unparalleled during tracking?
    Suddenness of change? Changepoint analysis? The suddenness at the end isn't
    like the US unemployment stats -- it's not enough to pop by itself.
4.  Do we understand the drop-off in previous cycles?
5.  In the United States, we have seasonality in our prices. Do those not 
    materialize here?
    
### Critique

1.  The choice here is two line series. They track very closely, so not sure the
    second series gives a lot of information. Color choices are opposite of the 
    U.S. gas colors, but maybe that's ok. (Makes the removed legend a challenge,
    though). Axes are pretty straightforward. The cushion underneath the lines 
    feels good - close to the 30% heuristic.
2.  Would love a history here - not just what the chart values on hover are 
    (which is nice), but an explanation of the changepoints. 
3.  For our current uses, we're probably more interested in changes than absolute
    indices.


### Exploration

#### Longer timeline

```{r longer_timeline, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8}
# TODO - Try plotly here, https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/about/
df %>%
  gather(key = "fuel_type", value = "price_per_litre", -date) %>%
  mutate(fuel_type = fct_recode(fuel_type,
                                Diesel = "diesel_usd", Petrol = "petrol_usd")) %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, price_per_litre)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour = fuel_type)) +
  theme_light() + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year") +
  labs(title = "Comparison of petrol vs. diesel fuel prices",
       subtitle = "Average retail pump prices per liter (pence), measured weekly",
       x = "", 
       y = "",
       colour = "Fuel type",
       caption = "RAC Foundation (Source: BEIS)") +  
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(40, 160), 
                     labels = scales::comma_format(suffix = "p"))


```
