### Critique

1.  The choice here is two line series. They track very closely, so not sure the
    second series gives a lot of information. Color choices are opposite of the 
    U.S. gas colors, but maybe that's ok. (Makes the removed legend a challenge,
    though). Axes are pretty straightforward. The cushion underneath the lines 
    feels good - close to the 30% heuristic.
2.  Would love a history here - not just what the chart values on hover are 
    (which is nice), but an explanation of the changepoints. 
3.  For our current uses, we're probably more interested in changes than absolute
    indices.

### Replicate original

```{r replicate_original, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8}
# TODO - Refine panel, labels in line (or in subtitle)
df %>%
  gather(key = "fuel_type", value = "price_per_litre", -date) %>%
  mutate(fuel_type = fct_recode(fuel_type,
                                Diesel = "diesel_usd", Petrol = "petrol_usd")) %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.)) %>%
  filter(date > ymd("2010-04-01")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, price_per_litre)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour = fuel_type)) +
  theme_light() + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year") +
  labs(title = "Comparison of petrol vs. diesel fuel prices",
       subtitle = "Average retail pump prices per litre (pence), measured weekly",
       x = "", 
       y = "",
       colour = "Fuel type",
       caption = "RAC Foundation (Source: BEIS)") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(80, 160), 
                     labels = scales::comma_format(suffix = "p"))

```

### Questions

1.  The two indices basically track. Does one forecast the other? Can we think
    of this like FedEx shipping volumes dropping as a recessionary indicator? 
    Might expect more volatility in diesel (smaller supply, specialized 
    refinement)? 
2.  Does the 10-year rolling average hide insights? Do we need to see (multiple)
    shorter windows? Longer windows?
3.  We're obviously seeing a recent plunge -- unparalleled during tracking?
    Suddenness of change? Changepoint analysis? The suddenness at the end isn't
    like the US unemployment stats -- it's not enough to pop by itself.
4.  Do we understand the drop-off in previous cycles? Do demand shocks (like
    current Coronavirus shock and 2008 financial collapse) behave differently?
5.  In the United States, we have seasonality in our prices. Do those not 
    materialize here?
6.  Doesn't foot with our mental model of petroleum - shouldn't the negative
    prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) mean something for the price at the
    pump?
    
    
### Exploration

#### Longer timeline

```{r longer_timeline, echo = FALSE}
# TODO - Try plotly here, https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/about/
df %>%
  gather(key = "fuel_type", value = "price_per_litre", -date) %>%
  mutate(fuel_type = fct_recode(fuel_type,
                                Diesel = "diesel_usd", Petrol = "petrol_usd")) %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, price_per_litre)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour = fuel_type)) +
  theme_light() + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year") +
  labs(title = "Comparison of petrol vs. diesel fuel prices",
       subtitle = "Average retail pump prices per liter (pence), measured weekly",
       x = "", 
       y = "",
       colour = "Fuel type",
       caption = "RAC Foundation (Source: BEIS)") +  
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(40, 160), 
                     labels = scales::comma_format(suffix = "p"))


```

#### Smoothed

```{r smoothed, echo=FALSE}
df %>%
  gather(key = "fuel_type", value = "price_per_litre", -date) %>%
  mutate(fuel_type = fct_recode(fuel_type,
                                Diesel = "diesel_usd", Petrol = "petrol_usd")) %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, price_per_litre)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = zoo::rollmean(price_per_litre, 8, na.pad = TRUE),
                colour = fuel_type)) +
  theme_light() + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year") +
  labs(title = "Comparison of petrol vs. diesel fuel prices",
       subtitle = "Rolling 8-week average retail pump prices per liter (pence), measured weekly",
       x = "", 
       y = "",
       colour = "Fuel type",
       caption = "RAC Foundation (Source: BEIS)") +  
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(40, 160), 
                     labels = scales::comma_format(suffix = "p"))

```

#### Percent changes

Here, we're taking a lot of liberty by lagging a rolling average against a
rolling average. That's probably not great, so we need to figure out how to
smooth the values appropriately.

Nonetheless, we can start to see the really strong slope changes - not just
currently, but the multi-stage dropoff leading into the 2008 recession. Diesel
seems a bit more muted in declines.

We should probably look at sequential declines, not single week drop-off,
though. The recent decline is at least 15%, and that's not reflected well.

```{r lag_slope, echo = FALSE}
df %>%
  gather(key = "fuel_type", value = "price_per_litre", -date) %>%
  mutate(fuel_type = fct_recode(fuel_type,
                                Diesel = "diesel_usd", Petrol = "petrol_usd")) %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.)) %>%
  group_by(fuel_type) %>%
  mutate(roll_price_per_litre = zoo::rollmean(price_per_litre, 8, na.pad = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(pct_change_roll = (roll_price_per_litre - lag(roll_price_per_litre)) / roll_price_per_litre) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, pct_change_roll)) +
  geom_line(aes(col = fuel_type), alpha=.3, show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ fuel_type, nrow=2) +
  theme_light() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(accuracy=.1)) +
  labs(title = "% Change in rolling averages",
       y = "", 
       x = "")


```

#### Appendix
Attempted to use `changepoint` library, but this really isn't anywhere near
stable enough. 

```{r explore_changepoint, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
petrol_prices <- df %>% 
  filter(!is.na(petrol_usd)) %>%
  pull(petrol_usd)
cpt.mean(petrol_prices, minseglen = 10)

```
