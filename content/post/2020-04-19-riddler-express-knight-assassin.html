How many of his friends does he displace? What if there are <em>two</em> drunken
knights? What if there are <em>four</em> drunken knights? How drunk is he – does
he avoid ready victory (lookaheads)? Or stumble back and forth (retraces)?
Does he fall off the board?</li>

<blockquote>
<p>From Yan Zhang comes a royal murder mystery:<br />
 
Black Bishop: “Sir, forensic testing indicates the Queen’s assassin, the White Knight between us, has moved exactly eight times since the beginning of the game, which has been played by the legal rules.”<br />
Black King: “So?”<br />
 
Black Bishop: “Well, to convict this assassin, we need to construct a legal game history. But we just can’t figure out how he got there!”</p>
