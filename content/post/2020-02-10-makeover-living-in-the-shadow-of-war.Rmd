Like Philip Bump, my son has always lived under a shadow of war.

## Motivation
Like Philip Bump, my son has always lived under a shadow of war.

## Critique

**What works?**

**What doesn't work?**

1.  Perhaps because of the constraints of print, there is a lot to look at.
    Each year is detailed as a small multiple, but as a reader, I'm likely
    to explore only a handful of birth years -- my own, my child's, and my 
    parents. Interactivity?
2.  The outside dial doesn't show the years under war, but the *fraction of 
    life* under war. That's a harder concept, and because the lifespans change
    across the figure, the fractions also change.
3.  The dual dial structure is challenging, especially without the individual
    example shown in the article. The inside pie is an aggregation of the 
    outside progression.
4.  The really reductive view could be that this is a lot of ink to say that 
    the conflict in Afghanistan is historically long. 
5.  Another strange artifact is that the 3-year olds present have 100% of their
    lifespan in the shadow of war -- but that many other 3-year olds have faced
    similar. Something like a survival analysis here, where we cannot foretell
    how the lifes unfold -- but could look at it like a cohort.
