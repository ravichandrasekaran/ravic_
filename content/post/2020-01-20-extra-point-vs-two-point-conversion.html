<p>From the Riddler, a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-track-the-delirious-ducks/">proposal</a>
for a new-and-improved post-touchdown extra-point system to defeat the
repetitive extra point kicks. (Yeah!) <!--more--></p>
<div id="the-defense" class="section level2">
<h2>The defense</h2>
<div id="simple-strategies" class="section level4">
<h4>Simple strategies</h4>
<p>One simple, uniformed strategy the defense could employ would be to simply
defend against the 2-point conversion all the time. What would the offense’s
expected score be?</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
E[S_{CONV}] &amp; = p_{XP} \cdot (1.0) + 2 \cdot (1 - p_{XP}) \cdot (0.4) \\
&amp; = (0.2) \cdot p_{XP} +  0.8 \\
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>The other simple, uninformed strategy would be to always defend against the
extra point all the time. The expected score there would be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
E[S_{XP}] &amp; = p_{XP} \cdot (0.9) + 2 \cdot (1 - p_{XP}) \cdot (0.6) \\
&amp; = (-0.3) \cdot p_{XP} + (1.2) \\
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>We can graph both simple strategies and the offense’s expected score as a
function of their selected probability of going for the extra point <span class="math inline">\(p_{XP}\)</span>:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-01-20-extra-point-vs-two-point-conversion_files/figure-html/visualise_results-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
<div id="general-strategy" class="section level4">
<h4>General strategy</h4>
<p>Since the defense actually knows the offense’s selected probability of
going for the extra point, they can select the strategy that minimizes
the offense’s total scoring. They can defend against the two-point
conversion until they know that that the offense is very likely to go
for the extra point.</p>
<p>What’s the threshold? We can set the two scoring equations equal, and
that will give us the threshold at which we should change tack: <span class="math inline">\(p_{XP} = 0.8\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
E[S_{CONV}] &amp; = E[S_{XP}] \\
(0.2) \cdot p_{XP} +  0.8 &amp; = (-0.3) \cdot p_{XP} + (1.2) \\
(0.5) \cdot p_{XP} &amp; = 0.4 \\
p_{XP} &amp; = 0.8
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p><strong>So, the defense should defend against the two-point conversion until it
knows the offense is going to go for the extra point with at least a 80%
probability.</strong></p>

</div>
<div id="the-offense" class="section level2">
<h2>The offense</h2>
<div id="general-strategy-1" class="section level4">
<h4>General strategy</h4>
<p>The offense knows that the defense knows the offense’s strategy. (Ugh, that’s
a mouthful.) But using the same graph above, the maximum expected score under
the defense’s approach will also be at <span class="math inline">\(p_{XP} = 0.8\)</span>. Substituting into either
equation gives us an expected score of <span class="math inline">\(E[S] = 0.96\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>So, the offense should consistently send in a probability of 0.8, expecting to
score 0.96 points per attempt.</strong></p>
