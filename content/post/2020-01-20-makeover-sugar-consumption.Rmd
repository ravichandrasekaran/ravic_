#### Critique

**What works with this chart?**

1.  The headline is attention-grabbing. Triple the recommendation?!?
    How is that possible? 

**What doesn't work with this chart?**

1.  Age breakdown gets a lot of attention (17 groups!). But the message 
    I pull down is that free sugar consumption is well above target for 
    all ages. There are other ways to make it personally relevant.
3.  It's very hard to get a grasp on the level of consumption - in part
    due to the percentage targets, and in part because the baseline is 
    daily calorie consumption. Daily calorie consumption is hard because
    the target varies based on multiple factors including age and gender, 
    and because it is units that are very hard to conceptualize.
3.  For each bar, there's a "good" amount of free sugar, and excess above
    and beyond that level. Visually indicating the "safe", "warning", and
    "excessive" levels might bring more urgency.
4.  The headline is about "sugar", the recommendation and graphic relate
    to "free sugar" (or in US terms, "added sugar"). That's potentially
    a big distinction.
5.  The article is pushing a particular framing -- epidemic childhood
    obesity -- and a particular range of policy including tax and plain
    packaging for soda and candy. That's a piece of the chart's import,
    but a pretty small piece. Might play a guess-game for common products
    and their added sugar from the nutrition labelling to drive that 
    home.

#### Potential approaches

1.  Leverage the NHS's materialization in terms of sugar cubes. (Or the
    US USDA and HHS recommmendations in terms of teaspoons of added sugar).
2.  Make it personal. Allow configuration based on age and gender to more
    closely approximate the individual. (Or facet to allow reader to find 
    it.)
3.  Make it interactive. Guess how many calories from natural sugar. Then,
    free sugar. Surprise with truth!
4.  Choose-your-own-breakfast.
