1.  Drunken knight. How long does it take? How many foes accidentally killed? 
    How many of his friends does he displace? What if there are *two* drunken 
    knights? What if there are *four* drunken knights? How drunk is he -- does
    he avoid ready victory (lookaheads)? Or stumble back and forth (retraces)?
    Does he fall off the board?
2.  D3 sim?

> From Yan Zhang comes a royal murder mystery: \
\ 
Black Bishop: “Sir, forensic testing indicates the Queen’s assassin, the White Knight between us, has moved exactly eight times since the beginning of the game, which has been played by the legal rules.” 
\
Black King: “So?” \
\ 
Black Bishop: “Well, to convict this assassin, we need to construct a legal game history. But we just can’t figure out how he got there!”
