<p>From 538’s Riddler column, we have a timely challenge – a thought experiment
surrounding the {Baseball Hall of Fame}(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-pennies-should-you-pinch/" class="uri">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-pennies-should-you-pinch/</a>).

<h2>The challenge</h2>
<p>Derek Jeter and Larry Walker were just elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame! That got Stephanie thinking. Suppose there are 20 players on the ballot and 400 voters in a given year. Each voter can select up to 10 players for induction without voting for any given player more than once. To gain entry, a player must have been selected on at least 75 percent of the ballots.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, what is the maximum number of players that can be inducted into the Hall of Fame?</p>
</div>
<div id="early-thoughts" class="section level2">
<h2>Early thoughts</h2>
<p>A player needs to appear on 300 ballots (75% of 400 ballots). One scenario
would involve 300 of the voters colluding and submitting identical ballots.
This would give 10 players entry from their ballots, and render the remaining
voters’ ballots either superfluous or irrelevant.</p>
<p>Certainly, we can do better, and not waste quite so many votes!</p>
<p>Let’s imagine instead that the voters collude, but in six smaller groups:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{matrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 
\end{matrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>We’ve added 5 groups of voters. Each candidate now gets 5/6 * 400 votes,
and we’re covering a bit more ground with 2 more candidates. But we’re
still obviously wasting a lot of votes.</p>
</div>
<div id="approach" class="section level2">
<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>Let’s define:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of ballots <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</li>
<li>The number of available votes per ballot <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>.</li>
<li>The threshold for the fraction of ballots to induct, <span class="math inline">\(t = 3/4 = 0.75\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, we have these expressions for the total number of votes <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, and
the minimum number of votes required to induct <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
v &amp;= ba = 400 \cdot 10 = 4000 \\
i &amp;= bt = 400 \cdot (0.75) = 300
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>And we can develop an expression for the maximum number of inductees.
Note that the expression doesn’t depend on the number of ballots cast,
just the number of available votes per ballot and the threshold.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
c &amp; = \left\lfloor \frac{v}{t} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{ba}{bt} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{a}{t} \right\rfloor \\
&amp; = \left\lfloor \frac{10}{.75} \right\rfloor = 13
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Our ideal scenario is one where each winning candidate gets exactly the
number of votes he needs with no waste. Here, we would have
<span class="math display">\[ 
A: \{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8, x_9, x_10\}
B: \{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7,   ., .  , .   , x_{11}, x_{12}, x_{13}\}
C: \{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4,   .,   ., .  , x_8, x_9, x_10, x_{11}, x_{12}, x_{13}\}
D: \{x_1,   .,   .,   ., x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8, x_9, x_10, x_{11}, x_{12}, x_{13}\}
\]</span></p>
<hr />
<p>So, what could have happened if every year the writers got together and
colluded on their votes? Instead of the <strong>123</strong> actual
inductees through 2018, we would have 13 new inductees each year of the
voting, for <strong>949</strong> members of the Baseball Hall of Fame!</p>
