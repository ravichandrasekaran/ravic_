<p>From 538’s Riddler column, we have a timely challenge – a thought experiment
surrounding the {Baseball Hall of Fame}(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-pennies-should-you-pinch/" class="uri">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-pennies-should-you-pinch/</a>).

<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>Here’s the description from the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-pennies-should-you-pinch/">538 Riddler column</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Derek Jeter and Larry Walker were just elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame! That got Stephanie thinking. Suppose there are 20 players on the ballot and 400 voters in a given year. Each voter can select up to 10 players for induction without voting for any given player more than once. To gain entry, a player must have been selected on at least 75 percent of the ballots.<br />
<br />
Under these circumstances, what is the maximum number of players that can be inducted into the Hall of Fame?</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="approach" class="section level2">
<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>Let’s define:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of ballots <span class="math inline">\(b = 400\)</span>.</li>
<li>The number of available votes per ballot <span class="math inline">\(a = 10\)</span>.</li>
<li>The threshold for the fraction of ballots to induct, <span class="math inline">\(t = 3/4 = 0.75\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, we have two simple expressions for the total number of votes <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> and
the minimum number of votes required to induct <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
v &amp; = ba \\
i &amp; = bt \\
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>And then we can express <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, the maximum number of inductees.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
c &amp; = \left\lfloor \frac{v}{t} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{ba}{bt} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{a}{t} \right\rfloor \\
&amp; = \left\lfloor \frac{10}{.75} \right\rfloor = 13
\end{aligned}
\]</span>
<em>Note that the expression doesn’t depend on the number of ballots cast,
just the number of available votes per ballot and the threshold. (And the
screening for the ballot doesn’t matter either, as long as it provides
more candidates than <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.)</em></p>

<div id="answer" class="section level2">
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The maximum number of inductees in a given voting year is <strong>13</strong>.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="ramifications" class="section level2">
<h2>Ramifications</h2>
<p>So, what could have happened if every year the writers got together and
colluded on their votes? Through 2018, we’ve seen <strong>123</strong>
actual inductees – roughly <strong>2</strong> per year,
or 0.6% of the players who’ve played the
game.)</p>
<p>Instead, if the writers maxed out the total number of inductees, we would have
had <strong>13</strong> new inductees each year of the voting, for <strong>949</strong>
members of the Baseball Hall of Fame! (That would work out to
4.8% of all players.)</p>
<p>That seems a bit overly generous, but maxing out the inductees would avoid
the multi-year campaigning, and might ensure the induction of some players
who were close to the 75% threshold without quite getting there.</p>

<div id="long-suffering-candidates" class="section level2">
<h2>Long-suffering candidates</h2>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at some of the players that missed the cutoff.
Here, we’re looking at those who hit the 15-year maximum allowed voting,
and came close but didn’t get to the 75% threshold.</p>

<p>When would they have gotten in?</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Get player and Hall of Fame voting data from the Lahman package
require(&quot;Lahman&quot;, quietly = TRUE, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

data(Master)
players &lt;- Master %&gt;%
  mutate_at(vars(debut, finalGame), ymd) %&gt;%
  select(playerID, debut, finalGame, nameGiven, nameFirst, nameLast, deathDate)

data(HallOfFame)
df &lt;- HallOfFame %&gt;%
  filter(votedBy == &quot;BBWAA&quot;) %&gt;%
  left_join(players, by = &quot;playerID&quot;) 

voting_years &lt;- df %&gt;%
  distinct(yearID) %&gt;%
  arrange(yearID) %&gt;%
  pull(yearID)

# Set up inductees dataframe
inductees &lt;- df %&gt;% 
  filter(0 == 1)

# Starting in 1936, get the top ranked 13 players and induct them.
# Then, for subsequent years, get the top-ranked 13 players that 
# haven&#39;t already been inducted.

for(idx in voting_years) {
  current_inductees &lt;- df %&gt;% 
    filter(yearID == idx) %&gt;%
    anti_join(inductees, by = &quot;playerID&quot;) %&gt;%
    mutate(year_rank = rank(desc(votes), ties.method = &quot;max&quot;)) %&gt;%
    filter(year_rank &lt;= 13)
  inductees &lt;- bind_rows(inductees, current_inductees)
}</code></pre>
<p>Not surprisingly, all of these players would have gotten in on their first
voting year, even with some paltry votes in some cases.</p>
<pre><code>##        full_name votes ballots year
## 1    Red Ruffing    22     153 1949
## 2     Nellie Fox    39     360 1971
## 3    Jim Bunning   146     383 1977
## 4 Orlando Cepeda    48     385 1980
## 5    Jack Morris   111     499 2000</code></pre>
