<h4>Problem</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the course of three days, suppose the probability of any spammer making a new comment on this week’s Riddler column over a very short time interval is proportional to the length of that time interval. (For those in the know, I’m saying that spammers follow a Poisson process.) On average, the column gets one brand-new comment of spam per day that is not a reply to any previous comments. Each spam comment or reply also gets its own spam reply at an average rate of one per day.<br />
 
For example, after three days, I might have four comments that were not replies to any previous comments, and each of them might have a few replies (and their replies might have replies, which might have further replies, etc.).<br />
 
After the three days are up, how many total spam posts (comments plus replies) can I expect to have?</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>We already knew that the mean number of comments without spawning new
threads with a rate of 1 per day for 3 days was 3 comments, using a
basic Poisson process (with a variance of 3 as well.)</p>
<p>With our simulation, we can see a much higher number of comments (~19 over
3 days time), and an extremely high variance.</p>
