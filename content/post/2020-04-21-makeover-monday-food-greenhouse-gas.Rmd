### Notes from original

1.  "Pound-for-pound". 
2.  Beef is bad. Beef has more total greenhouse gas emissions.
3.  A range of different approaches -- "Eat Local.", "Farm to Table", "Raw food",
    "Vegan" - have different impacts
4.  The original authors are pushing more for consumers to adopt plant-based meat,
    and avoid discretionary things like sugar/stimulants/alcohol.
5.  The revised article discussion focuses more on the fallacy of "Eat Local." 
    But even more, that highlights that our mental model of food + greenhouse gases
    is wrong. 


### Concept notes

1.  Beef is far and away the biggest greenhouse gas producer using these 
    metrics.
2.  There are lots of pairwise comparisons for explainers. New Zealand 
    lamb vs. beef, dairy vs. beef herd, seafood farming, etc. Each one
    might expose a piece of the mental model that's missing.
3.  Can we distill down the protein message? Substitute plants generally. 
    Believe in the Impossible (Burger). Land use is a big deal. 
4.  Many ways to prioritize, not all represented (e.g. water use). Can
    we expose that directly? "Eat Local" vs. "Avoid processed"
5.  The metric is weird, and hard to grasp (kg of $\text{CO}_2$)? And 
    the kg of food product is not how we consume - especially when 
    considering substitutes.

```{r protein_trade, include = FALSE, fig.width=8}
df %>% 
  filter(food_category %in% c("Meat", "Seafood", "Plant proteins")) %>%
  mutate(total_co2 = land_use_change + animal_feed + farm + processing + transport + packaging) %>%
  mutate(food_product = fct_reorder(food_product, total_co2)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = food_product, y = total_co2)) +
  geom_col(fill = "lightblue") + 
  theme_light() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0.1, .05)),
                     labels = label_number(accuracy = .1)) + 
  labs(
    title = "Greenhouse gases production - protein foods",
    subtitle = "Kg of greenhouse gases per kg of food product",
    y = "",
    x = ""
  ) 

```

#### Reproduction

Like always, start with a basic reproduction.

```{r breakout_greenhouse_gases, echo = FALSE, fig.width=8}
df %>% 
  filter(food_category %in% c("Meat", "Seafood", "Plant proteins")) %>%
  mutate(total_co2 = land_use_change + animal_feed + farm + processing + transport + packaging) %>%
  mutate(food_product = fct_reorder(food_product, total_co2)) %>%
  select(food_product, everything(), -total_co2, -row_number, -food_category) %>%
  gather(key="pipeline", value="emissions", -food_product) %>%
  mutate(pipeline = str_to_title(str_replace_all(pipeline, "_", " "))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = food_product, y = emissions, fill = pipeline, group=food_product)) +
  geom_col() + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(.05, .05)),
                     labels = label_number(accuracy = .1)) + 
  theme_light() +
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(
    title = "Breakout of greenhouse gas sources - Proteins",
    x = "",
    y = "",
    fill = "Production source") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual")
```


```{r protein_spotlight, include = FALSE, fig.width = 8}
df %>% 
  filter(food_category %in% c("Meat", "Seafood", "Plant proteins")) %>%
  gather(key = "pipeline", value = "emissions", -row_number, -food_product, -food_category) %>%
  mutate(pipeline = str_to_title(str_replace_all(pipeline, "_", " "))) %>%
  mutate(pipeline = fct_lump(pipeline, n = 3, w = abs(emissions))) %>%
  add_count(food_product, wt = emissions, name = "total_co2") %>%
  mutate(food_product = fct_reorder(food_product, total_co2)) %>%
  mutate(pipeline = fct_reorder(pipeline, emissions)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = food_product, y = emissions)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = pipeline)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual") +
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_light() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(title = "Slightly better",
       x = "",
       y = "") 
  
```

#### Lollipop
This is getting closer to something possibly useful. We're starting with
a message that by any measure, beef is **crazy high**. So, basically, we
need a scorecard.

*Design notes*:

1.  Land use, farm, and possibly feed need to be listed at the top. 
    (Not clear what the sort is now.)
2.  Colors could be more precise. Meat should be red and pink, plants green 
    and brown.
3.  Gridding seems excessive.
4.  Can we drop one?
5.  Annotations!
6.  We're losing some precision in the plant-based protein. That's ok, right?
7.  Is cheese a protein? Is soymilk a protein?

```{r another_view, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height=10}
# Lollipop or scatter?
df %>% 
  filter(food_category %in% c("Meat", "Seafood", "Plant proteins")) %>%
  gather(key = "pipeline", value = "emissions", -row_number, -food_product, -food_category) %>%
  mutate(pipeline = str_to_title(str_replace_all(pipeline, "_", " "))) %>%
  add_count(food_product, wt = emissions, name = "total_co2") %>%
  mutate(food_product = fct_reorder(food_product, -total_co2)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pipeline, y = emissions)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = food_product), show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_light() + 
  facet_wrap(~ food_product, ncol=3, nrow=5) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        strip.text = element_text(colour = "black", hjust = 0)) +
  labs(title = expression("Comparison of"~CO[2]~"- Protein food products"),
       subtitle = "For 1 kg of food product, 1 kg of greenhouse gas contribution by pipeline step",
       x = "",
       y = ""
  ) +
  geom_segment(aes(y=0, yend=emissions, xend=pipeline, color = food_product),
               show.legend = FALSE)

               

```

#### Other concepts
* Thought about a radar chart here, but this strong critique advised me against it.
