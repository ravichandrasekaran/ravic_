### Notes

1.  "Pound-for-pound". 
2.  Beef is bad. Beef has more total greenhouse gas emissions.
3.  A range of different approaches -- "Eat Local.", "Farm to Table", "Raw food",
    "Vegan" - have different impacts
4.  The original authors are pushing more for consumers to adopt plant-based meat,
    and avoid discretionary things like sugar/stimulants/alcohol.
5.  The revised article discussion focuses more on the fallacy of "Eat Local." 
    But even more, that highlights that our mental model of food + greenhouse gases
    is wrong.
