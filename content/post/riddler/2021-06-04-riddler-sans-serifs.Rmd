From the Riddler, a problem concerning typography and topology. Eureka!

<!--more-->

### Problem

In [this week's Riddler][riddler-problem], via Alexander Zhang, we're invited to consider this *sans-serif* font example:  

![Font face](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-05-31-at-6.53.29-PM.png?w=700)

> Alexander thinks many of these letters are equivalent, but he leaves it to you to figure out how and why. He also has a message for you: **YIRTHA**. It may not look like much, but Alexander assures me that it is equivalent to exactly one word in the English language.

### Approach

The word *sans-serif* is an unintentional clue, which means we should look carefully at the letterforms. Here, I think the mapping is based on the **number of distinct strokes** -- where one has to pick up the pen to write the letter as shown without traversing a section twice. (The specific font face matters here, since, for example, `K` as shown is a three-stroke letter.)

Then all that's left is to load [Peter Norvig's word list][norvig-word-list], map the letters to strokes, and found the candidate answers.

### Answer

I know that there's supposed to only be one unique answer, but I found these three candidates. **EUREKA** feels like it's got the right celebratory feel, though :)

1.  **EUREKA**
2.  **TWEAKY**
2.  **APATHY**

### Extension

Assuming our mapping of letterforms matches Alexander's intent, we can also use this to pull out words whose stroke counts match only one word. That list, sorted by [Norvig's word frequency][norvig-word-freq] data, is shown below, featuring words like **HEALTH, THOUGH, CHURCH**. (It's heavy on the `H` and `K` letters, since they are the only ones that require three strokes in this font face.)


### Code 

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Get word list
pdf = (
    pd.read_csv("https://norvig.com/ngrams/enable1.txt", header=None, names=["word"])
    .assign(word = lambda x: x.word.str.upper())
)
```


```{python encoding}
# Set up mapping of letter to number of distinct strokes
translation_table = str.maketrans({
    "A": "2", "B": "1", "C": "1", "D": "1", "E": "2",
    "F": "2", "G": "1", "H": "3", "I": "1", "J": "1",
    "K": "3", "L": "1", "M": "1", "N": "1", "O": "1",
    "P": "1", "Q": "2", "R": "2", "S": "1", "T": "2",
    "U": "1", "V": "1", "W": "1", "X": "2", "Y": "2",
    "Z": "1",
})

# Determine candidates based on translation
candidates = (
    pdf
    .assign(encoded = lambda x: x.word.str.translate(translation_table))
    .loc[lambda x: x.encoded == "YIRTHA".translate(translation_table)]
)
candidates
```

#### Unique words


```{python unique-words}
pd.set_option('max_rows', 80) 
word_freq = (
    pd.read_csv(
        "https://norvig.com/ngrams/count_1w100k.txt", header=None, 
        names=["word", "freq"], sep="\t", 
        dtype={
            "word": str,
            "freq": "Int64"
        }
    )
    .assign(word = lambda x: x.word.str.strip())
)

unique_words = (
    pdf
    .assign(encoded = lambda x: x.word.str.translate(translation_table))
    .groupby("encoded")
    .agg(word_count=("word", "count"))
    .loc[lambda x: x.word_count == 1]
    .reset_index()
    .loc[lambda x: x.encoded.str.len() == 6]
)
(
    pdf
    .assign(encoded = lambda x: x.word.str.translate(translation_table))
    .merge(unique_words, how="inner", on="encoded")
    .merge(word_freq, how="inner", on="word")
    .sort_values(by=["freq"], ascending=[False])
)
```
