<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>From the Riddler, an extension to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-find-the-best-dungeons-dragons-strategy/">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fifth edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons introduced a system of “advantage and disadvantage.” When you roll a die “with advantage,” you roll the die twice and keep the higher result. Rolling “with disadvantage” is similar, except you keep the lower result instead. The rules further specify that when a player rolls with both advantage and disadvantage, they cancel out, and the player rolls a single die. Yawn!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two other, more mathematically interesting ways that advantage and disadvantage could be combined. First, you could have “advantage of disadvantage,” meaning you roll twice with disadvantage and then keep the higher result. Or, you could have “disadvantage of advantage,” meaning you roll twice with advantage and then keep the lower result. With a fair 20-sided die, which situation produces the highest expected roll: advantage of disadvantage, disadvantage of advantage or rolling a single die?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Extra Credit: Instead of maximizing your expected roll, suppose you need to roll N or better with your 20-sided die. For each value of N, is it better to use advantage of disadvantage, disadvantage of advantage or rolling a single die?</p>

<h2>Answers</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Disadvantage-of-advantage gives the highest expected outcome: <strong>11.17</strong> vs.
10.5 for a straight roll, and 9.83 for advantage-of-disadvantage.</li>
<li>If you need to roll N or better, you will want to use disadvantage-of-advantage
for <span class="math inline">\(1 \le N \le 13\)</span>, then resort to a straight roll for <span class="math inline">\(14 \le N \le 20\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="analytic-approach" class="section level2">
<h2>Analytic approach</h2>
<p>Lots of order statistics. Order statistics on top of other order statistics.</p>
<div id="formulation" class="section level3">
<h3>Formulation</h3>
<p>Let’s start with disadvantage of advantage.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
p_X(k) &amp; = \frac{1}{20} \\
F_X(k) &amp; = \frac{k}{20} \\
\\
A &amp; = \max(X_1, X_2) = X_{max} \\
F_A(k) &amp;= \left[F_X(k)\right]^2 \\
&amp; = \frac{k^2}{20^2} \\
\\
D &amp; = \min(A_1, A_2) = A_{min} \\
1 - F_D(k) &amp;= \left[1 - F_A(k)\right]^2 \\
F_D(k) &amp;= 1 - \left[1 - \frac{k^2}{20^2}\right]^2 \\
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Getting close. From here, we can get the probability mass function <span class="math inline">\(p_D(k)\)</span> for
<span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, our random variable for disadvantage-of-advantage. And with that, we can
express the expectation <span class="math inline">\(E[D]\)</span> .</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
p_D(k) &amp; = F_D(k) - F_D(k-1) \\
E[D] &amp; = \sum_k k \cdot p_D(k) \\
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level3">
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Our expectation for disadvantage-of-advantage <span class="math inline">\(E[D]\)</span> works out to
<strong>11.17</strong>. So, we get a little help above a
straight roll with an expectation of 10.5. That matches some intutition
– the advantage steps insulates us against the worst outcomes.</p>
<p>We can plot the probability mass function, too. It’s pretty hard to get
either extreme – the disadvantage step makes it hard to get 20, and the
advantage makes it hard to get a 1.</p>

</div>
<div id="what-about-advantage-of-disadvantage" class="section level3">
<h3>What about advantage-of-disadvantage?</h3>
<p>We could do the same order statistics for advantage-of-disadvantage. But
that would be a drag. Instead, we’ll just realize that it’s the same
probability mass function, just flipped over the line at <span class="math inline">\(x = 10.5\)</span>. As
<a href="https://genius.com/1227305">Missy Elliott would advise</a>, we need to “put
our thing down, flip it and reverse it.”</p>
<p>Our expectation for advantage-of-disadvantage works out to <span class="math inline">\(E[A^{\prime}] = \textbf{9.83}\)</span>.
And because the the advantage-of-disadvantage is consistently worse than a
straight roll, we won’t even bother considering it for the rest.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-happens-with-more-faces" class="section level3">
<h3>What happens with more faces?</h3>
<p>Looks a lot like <span class="math inline">\(E[D] = E[X] + \frac{2}{3}\)</span>. That can’t be a coincidence.</p>
<p>We can leverage a second expression for expectation of a discrete distribution,
and <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PowerSum.html">Faulhaber’s Formula</a> to get
an expression for <span class="math inline">\(E[D]\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> be the number of faces on the die, then:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
E[D] &amp; = \sum k \cdot p_D(k) \\
&amp; = \sum_{k=0}^m [1 - F_D(k)] \\
&amp; = \sum_{k=0}^m \left[1 - \frac{k^2}{m^2}\right]^2 \\
\\
\sum k^2 &amp; = \frac{1}{3}m^3 + \frac{1}{2}m^2 + \frac{1}{6}m \\
\sum k^4 &amp; = \frac{1}{5}m^5 + \frac{1}{2}m^4 + \frac{1}{3}m^3 - \frac{1}{30}m \\
\\
E[D] &amp; = \frac{8}{15}m + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{30m^3} \\
&amp; \approx \frac{8}{15}m + \frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>And now we can express the differences between the two expectations as a function
of the number of sides on the dice:
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
E[D] - E[X] &amp; \approx [\frac{8}{15}m + \frac{1}{2}] - [\frac{m + 1}{2}] \\
&amp; \approx \frac{1}{30}m \\
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>And there’s our <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{3}\)</span>, hiding in plain sight.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="extra-credit" class="section level3">
<h3>Extra credit</h3>
<p>We already have most of the pieces in place for the extra credit. We can think
of the probability of getting <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> or better as:
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
P(\text{outcome} \ge N) &amp; = 1 - F(N - 1) \\
\\
F_X(k) &amp; = \frac{k}{20} \\
F_D(k) &amp;= 1 - \left[1 - \left(\frac{k}{20}\right)^2\right]^2 \\
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>And then we can build a table, which matches our intuition from before – that
disadvantage-of-advantage has a hard time reaching the extremes.</p>
