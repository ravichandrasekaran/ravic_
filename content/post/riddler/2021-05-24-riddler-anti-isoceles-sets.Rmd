A Riddler challenge involving anti-isoceles sets.

```{r load-packages, include=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
```
```{r include=FALSE}
library("here")
best <- readr::read_csv(here("static/data/riddler", "isoceles-best.csv"))
iso_lengths <- readr::read_csv(here("static/data/riddler", "isoceles-set-lengths.csv"), col_types = cols())
```

### Problem

This feels like a NP-complete problem, where we are faced with too many possibilities to recursively exhaust for an exact answer for anything more than a small grid width $N$. Not quite sure yet which of the [Karp problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karp%27s_21_NP-complete_problems) most resembles this one, though. My approach here was simply to use the brute-force recursive approach, which allowed me to find solutions up to $N = 7$.  

While getting exact answers is possible for a limited range of grid-widths, the broader relationship seems hard to get a fix on.

### Limited solutions

The maximum size for the anti-isoceles set at each given grid-width is given here, with example plots below.  

```{r basic-summary, echo = FALSE}
best %>%
  group_by(grid_size) %>%
  summarise(anti_isoceles_set_size = max(size),
            .groups = "drop")
```


```{r example-solutions, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
best %>%
  group_by(grid_size) %>%
  filter(idx == min(idx)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~grid_size) +
  theme_light() +
  labs(subtitle = "Examples of largest anti-isoceles sets",
       x = NULL, y = NULL)
```



### Unique distances in the grid


```{r unique-distances, include=FALSE}
tbl <- tibble(
  grid_size = 1:7,
  non_isoceles_size = c(1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10),
  unq_distances = c(1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 20, 27))
```

Is the maximum size of the anti-isoceles set a function of the number of unique distances in the grid? The number of unique distances in the grid is a sequence with initial terms `r tbl$unq_distances`, and discussed as [OEIS A047800](https://oeis.org/A047800). 

The OEIS entry includes this conjecture from Vaclav Kotesovec (after Landau and ErdÅ‘s), which shows a mostly quadratic term from the triangular sequence muted somewhat.

$a(n) \sim c \cdot \frac{n^2}{\sqrt{\log(n)}}, c = 0.79$


### Unique distances and relationship to largest anti-isoceles set

We might pose a possible relationship between the root of the number of unique distances and the size of the largest anti-isoceles set for a given grid width $N$. Basically, that the relationship is roughly linear with $N$, but takes into account that muting term above. Here, we plot these values, fitting a square root curve to the data.

```{r unique-distances-plot, fig.width=6, fig.height=6*5/8, echo = FALSE}
tbl %>%
  ggplot(aes(unq_distances, non_isoceles_size)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", formula=y ~ sqrt(x), se = F, color="black", 
              size=.5, lty=2) +
  labs(subtitle = paste0("Relationship between largest anti-isoceles set ",
                         "and unique distances in the grid"),
       x = "Unique distances",
       y = "Size of anti-isoceles set") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 10, 2), minor_breaks=0:10)  +
  theme_light() 
```


### Distribution of anti-isoceles set sizes

Looking beyond just the largest anti-isoceles set, it seems like that perhaps we can model the distribution at play here, using a Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distribution. Does that suggest the a range of likely maximum values for each grid size?  

```{r distributions, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE}
iso_lengths %>%
  ggplot(aes(size, sets)) +
  geom_col(fill = "lightblue") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank()) +
  facet_wrap(~grid_size, scales="free_y") +
  labs(subtitle = "Distribution of anti-isoceles set sizes",
       x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:10, minor_breaks=NULL)
```
