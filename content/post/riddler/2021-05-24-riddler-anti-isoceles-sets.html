<p>A Riddler challenge involving anti-isoceles sets.</p>

<div id="problem" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>This feels like a NP-complete problem, where we are faced with too many possibilities to recursively exhaust for an exact answer for anything more than a small grid width <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. Not quite sure yet which of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karp%27s_21_NP-complete_problems">Karp problems</a> most resembles this one, though. My approach here was simply to use the brute-force recursive approach, which allowed me to find solutions up to <span class="math inline">\(N = 7\)</span>.</p>
<p>While getting exact answers is possible for a limited range of grid-widths, the broader relationship seems hard to get a fix on.</p>

<div id="unique-distances-in-the-grid" class="section level3">
<h3>Unique distances in the grid</h3>
<p>Is the maximum size of the anti-isoceles set a function of the number of unique distances in the grid? The number of unique distances in the grid is a sequence with initial terms 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 20, 27, and discussed as <a href="https://oeis.org/A047800">OEIS A047800</a>.</p>
<p>The OEIS entry includes this conjecture from Vaclav Kotesovec (after Landau and Erd≈ës), which shows a mostly quadratic term from the triangular sequence muted somewhat.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(a(n) \sim c \cdot \frac{n^2}{\sqrt{\log(n)}}, c = 0.79\)</span></p>
</div>
<div id="unique-distances-and-relationship-to-largest-anti-isoceles-set" class="section level3">
<h3>Unique distances and relationship to largest anti-isoceles set</h3>
<p>We might pose a possible relationship between the root of the number of unique distances and the size of the largest anti-isoceles set for a given grid width <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. Basically, that the relationship is roughly linear with <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, but takes into account that muting term above. Here, we plot these values, fitting a square root curve to the data.</p>

<div id="distribution-of-anti-isoceles-set-sizes" class="section level3">
<h3>Distribution of anti-isoceles set sizes</h3>
<p>Looking beyond just the largest anti-isoceles set, it seems like that perhaps we can model the distribution at play here, using a Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distribution. Does that suggest the a range of likely maximum values for each grid size?</p>
